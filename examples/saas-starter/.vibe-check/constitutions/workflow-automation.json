  "rules": [
    "CRITICAL: Implement proper error handling with retry logic",
    "CRITICAL: Use proper wait strategies (not arbitrary sleeps)",
    "HIGH: Use stable selectors (data-testid, role, label) over fragile CSS selectors",
    "HIGH: Add timeout configuration for all operations",
    "HIGH: Implement graceful degradation for failed automation steps",
    "HIGH: Clean up resources (close browsers, delete temp files) after execution",
    "MEDIUM: Add logging and tracing for debugging failed workflows",
    "MEDIUM: Use page object model pattern for maintainable automation code",
    "MEDIUM: Implement retry mechanism for transient failures",
    "MEDIUM: Add screenshots or videos for failed automation runs"

  "antiPatterns": [
    "Using sleep() instead of proper wait conditions",
    "Fragile CSS selectors that break on UI changes",
