  "rules": [
    "CRITICAL: Write tests BEFORE implementing features (TDD approach)",
    "CRITICAL: Achieve minimum 80% code coverage for new features",
    "CRITICAL: Test both success paths and error/edge cases",
    "HIGH: Clean up test data after each test (avoid test pollution)",
    "HIGH: Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested",
    "HIGH: Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases) for unit tests",
    "HIGH: Run full test suite before committing code",
    "MEDIUM: Test cross-browser compatibility for frontend features",
    "MEDIUM: Add integration tests for critical user workflows",
    "MEDIUM: Use test doubles appropriately (mocks, stubs, spies)",
    "MEDIUM: Keep tests fast and independent"

    "Skipping tests for 'simple' code",
    "Tests that depend on execution order",
